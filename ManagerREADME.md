Hi, welcome to the Daughtridge Sales team.

It’s going to take a solid quarter to figure this place out. I understand the importance of first impressions, and I know you want to get a check in the win column, but this is a complex place full of equally complex humans. Take your time, meet everyone, go to every meeting you can, write things down, and ask all the questions – especially about all those baffling acronyms and emoji.

One of the working relationships we need to define is ours. The following is a user guide for me and how I work. It captures what you can expect out of the average week working with me, how I like to work, my guiding principles, and some of my, uh, nuance. My intent is to accelerate our working relationship with this document.[^1]

## Our Average Week
We’ll have a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes except during HIGH ALERT (See below). This meeting discusses topics of substance (work balance, goals, areas of difficulty), and very little updates on a specific task. Soapbox provides a private place for us to capture topics and notes for discussion for our 1:1s as well as to provide a handy historic record of what we’ve discussed. When you or I think of a topic, we add it to the agenda. 

We’ll have a staff meeting with your peers every week for 60 minutes no matter what. We have a shared soapbox agenda which captures agenda topics for the entire team. This is an overview of status and direction. Agenda topics that require a deeper dive are scheduled for other times with those that need to be present.

You can Slack me 24 hours a day. I tend to respond as quickly as possible. Times were response is slower
- When I am with my family (Weekends, meals)
- Driving to/from the office
- Vacation
- Someone just dropped a information bomb and I need to think for a minute

If I am traveling for work, I will give you notice of said travel in advance. All our meetings still occur albeit with time zone considerations.

I work a bit on the weekends. This is my choice. **I do not expect that you are going to work on the weekend.** I might Slack you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday.

I take vacations. You should, too. Disconnected from work is when I do some of my best work. 

## Guiding Principles
**Humans first.** I believe that happy, informed, and productive humans build fantastic product. I optimize for the humans. Other leaders will maximize the business, the technology, or any other number of important facets. Ideological diversity is key to an effective team. All perspectives are relevant, and we need all these leaders, but my bias is towards building productive humans.

**I see things as systems.** I reduce all complex things (including humans) into systems. I think in terms of connected web structures. I take great joy in attempting to understand how these systems and connections all fit together. When I see large or small inefficiencies in systems, I’d like to fix them with your help.

**It is important to me that humans are treated fairly.** I believe that most humans are trying to to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity.

**I heavily bias towards action.** Long meetings where we are endlessly debating potential directions are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. This is not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to debate.

**Once a decision is reached it is acted upon** Reaching a decision takes time. Starting should not. If there was a discussion you are a part of and a decision is made go with it. If you don't like it or agree, that is fine. THere are many decisions I do not like or agree. This is human. Make them known. Do not bring your dissent up later just because.

**Once a decision is determined to be the wrong one... Stop. Evaulate. Alter.** Sometimes a decision is wrong. That is fine. Own it and evaluate. Trust me I currently hold the record for decisions that don't work on this team.

**I believe in the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things.** I believe quality assurance is everyone’s responsibility and there are bugs to be fixed everywhere… all the time.

**I start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved.** This has worked out well for me over my career. 

**I do not like to micro-manage.** This wastes my time and yours. However it is not a waste of my time to invest in assisting you in areas you need help. I would rather spend 4 hours working with you on something and we learn how to do it for the next time around, rather than 4 hours listing all tasks and steps for you to do a task.

**We are all responsible team members.** Deadlines, Decisions, Directions. We discuss these openly and name blockers, issues, potential solutions and problems. There is a time and place to debate all of these and I am open to debate. However, once these are established my expectation is that you know them, understand them, and operate by them. If we set a deadline after discussing that it is reasonable and it is missed without communication, I will be frustrated.

**Communication is key.** Blocker came up? Kid is sick? You need a haircut? Can't solve the issue at hand and are spinning in circles. Communicate. Create something cool and beneficial? Communicate. Long week and you just found the best gif meme? Communicate. It builds relationships and teams. This is especially critical in remote teams.

**I need you to know that sometimes we are in HIGH ALERT and things will get strange.** There is an exception to many of my practices and principles and that is when we are in a HIGH ALERT situation. HIGH ALERT conditions usually involve existential threats to our company. During this time, my usual people, process, and product protocols are secondary to countering this threat. If it is not obvious, I will alert you that I am in this state along with my best guess of when we'll be done. If I am constantly in this state, something is fundamentally wrong. 

## Feedback Protocol
I firmly believe that feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team.

121's are our principle feedback loop.

Disagreement is feedback and the sooner we learn how to efficiently disagree with each other, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better with agreement.

## Meeting Protocol
I go to a lot of meetings. I would rather be coding and creating.

My definition of a meeting includes an agenda and/or intended purpose, the appropriate amount of productive attendees, and a responsible party running the meeting to a schedule. If I am attending a meeting, I’d prefer starting on time. If I am running a meeting, I will start that meeting on time. If it’s not clear to me why I am in a meeting, I will ask for clarification on my attendance. 

## Nuance and Errata

**I am an introvert** and that means that prolonged exposure to humans is exhausting for me. Weird, huh? Meetings with three of us are perfect, three to eight are ok, and more than eight you will find that I am strangely quiet. Do not confuse my quiet with lack of engagement.

**When the 1:1 feels over, and there is remaining time** I always have a couple of meaty topics to discuss. This is brainstorming, and the issues are usually front-of-mind hard topics that I am processing. It might feel like we’re shooting the shit, but we’re doing real work.

**When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined** you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.

**Ask assertive versus tell assertive.** When you need to ask me to do something, ask me. I respond incredibly well to ask assertiveness (“Rands, can you help with X?”). I respond poorly to being told what to do (“Rands, do X.”) I have been this way since I was a kid.

**I struggle with impatience and jumping ahead when looking at strategies** for planning or problem solving. It is not that I think I know more than you. I just have been looking at the problem or have other context that I forget you don't have. It is a jerk move and I am working on it. Call it out or ask for the context.

**I also swear sometimes.** Sorry.

**I love to start new things** but I often move on when someone else is doing the work and I can mentally see how the thing is going to finish which might be weeks or month before the thing is actually done. Sorry. I’m getting better at this. If you have questions or need me to reengage just say so.

**If I am on my phone during a meeting for more than 30 seconds, say something.** My attention wanders periodically.

**I believe in solving the smallest problem possible when a challenge is presented and there are no obvious solutions** Sometimes this is faster. Sometimes this is slower. If we are stuck and time is of the essence this is my default mode. Build on what works and cut the noise back to the point something does work.

**Humans stating opinions as facts** are a trigger for me. I don't need a dissertation but some information outside of an opinion is needed.

**Humans bringing a problem without a solution strategy** are a trigger for me. I am not interested in helping with a problem when no effort has been taken by the bearer. You may not have a solution but should have thought about possible solutions at least enough to know they won't work.

**This document is a [living breathing thing](https://github.com/randsleadershipslack/documents-and-resources/blob/master/howtorands.md)** and likely incomplete. I  update it frequently and would appreciate your feedback. 

I also stole the idea from [Rands](https://github.com/randsleadershipslack/documents-and-resources/blob/master/howtorands.md), so go steal and make your own version. It is a great exercise in personal reflection.
